> I started this project after ranting about WhatsApp on Twitter: https://twitter.com/bemayr/status/1056981431778529281

## Idea
The idea of this project is to reverse-engineer and document existing messengers like shown in [docs](./docs) to enable backing up and restoring the messages and contacts. After that I'm gonna try to write a *"cross messenger message converter"*.
This would allow us to escape the proprietary solutions like WhatsApp and move on to *open solutions* without losing our memories persisted as chats.
Apart from it being a bit of idealistic project it's really interesting to reverse-engineer the stuff and take a look how such huge messengers store their data.

## Reverse-Engineering-Results
- [WhatsApp on iOS](./docs/whatsapp/database/ios.md)

## Contributions
I would really love contributions of all kinds. ðŸ’“ Just open an issue or send me a PR to discuss the things you want to talk about. Or contact me on Twitter [@bemayr](https://twitter.com/bemayr).
I am trying to make the project more contribution-friendly in the next few weeks.
